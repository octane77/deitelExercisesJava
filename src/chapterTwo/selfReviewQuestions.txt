	 int  x, y, z, result;

d) Prompt the user to enter the first integer.
	System.out.print( "Enter first integer:" );

e) Read the first integer from the user and store it in the variable x.
	x = input.nextInt();

f) Prompt the user to enter the second integer.
	System.out.print( "Enter second integer:" );

g) Read the second integer from the user and store it in the variable y.
	y = input.nextInt();

h) Prompt the user to enter the third integer.
	System.out.print( "Enter third integer:" );

i) Read the third integer from the user and store it in the variable z.
	z = input.nextInt();

j) Compute the product of the three integers contained in variables x, y and z, and assign the result to the variable result.
	result = x * y * z;

k) Use System.out.printf to display the message "Product is" followed by the value of the variable result.
	System.out.printf( "Product is %d\n", result );

2.7 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:

a) Comments are used to document a program and improve its readability.

b) A decision can be made in a Java program with a(n) If statement.

c) Calculations are normally performed by assignment statements.

d) The arithmetic operators with the same precedence as multiplication are / division and % remainder .

e) When parentheses in an arithmetic expression are nested, the innermost set of parentheses is evaluated first.

f) A location in the computer’s memory that may contain different values at various times throughout the execution of a program is called a Variable.

2.8 Write Java statements that accomplish each of the following tasks:
a) Display the message "Enter an integer:", leaving the cursor on the same line.
	System.out.Print("Enter an integer");

b) Assign the product of variables b and c to variable a.
	a=b*c

c) Use a comment to state that a program performs a sample payroll calculation.
	// This program is used to perform payroll calculation

2.9 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.

a) Java operators are evaluated from left to right.
	This is false, some operators evaluate from right to left e.g Assignment

b) The following are all valid variable names: _under_bar_, m928134, t5, j7, her_sales$, his_$account_total, a, b$, c, z and z2.
	True

c) A valid Java arithmetic expression with no parentheses is evaluated from left to right.
	False. Expressions are evaluated according to operator precedence.

e) y = a * (x * x * x) + 7;

2.13 State the order of evaluation of the operators in each of the following Java statements, and show the value of x after each statement is performed:

a) x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1;

	3 * 6 = 18
    	18 / 2 = 9
    	7 + 9 = 16
    	16 - 1 = 15
    	x = 15

b) x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2;

	2 % 2 = 0
    	2 * 2 = 4
    	2 / 2 = 1
    	0 + 4 = 4
    	4 - 1 = 3
    	x = 3


c) x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / (3))));

	9 x 3 = 27

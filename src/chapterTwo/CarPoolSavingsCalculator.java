//2.35 (Car-Pool Savings Calculator) Research several car-pooling websites. Create an application
//that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by
//carpooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic
//congestion. The application should input the following information and display the userâ€™s cost per
//day of driving to work:
//a) Total miles driven per day.
//b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
//c) Average miles per gallon.
//d) Parking fees per day.
//e) Tolls per day.

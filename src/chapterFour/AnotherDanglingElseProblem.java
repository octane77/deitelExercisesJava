//4.27 (Dangling-else Problem) Determine the output for each of the given sets of code when x
//is 9 and y is 11 and when x is 11 and y is 9. The compiler ignores the indentation in a Java program.
//Also, the Java compiler always associates an else with the immediately preceding if unless told to
//do otherwise by the placement of braces ({}). On first glance, you may not be sure which if a particular
//else matches—this situation is referred to as the “dangling-else problem.” We’ve eliminated
//the indentation from the following code to make the problem more challenging. [Hint: Apply
//the indentation conventions you’ve learned.]
//b) if (x < 10)
//{
//if (y > 10)
//System.out.println("*****");
//}
//else
//{
//System.out.println("#####");
//System.out.println("$$$$$");
//}

//4.33 (Multiples of 2 with an Infinite Loop) Write an application that keeps displaying in the
//        command window the multiples of the integer 2â€”namely, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. Your loop
//        should not terminate (i.e., it should create an infinite loop). What happens when you run this program?

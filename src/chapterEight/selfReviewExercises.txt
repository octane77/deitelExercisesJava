8.1 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
a) A(n) imports all static members of a class.
b) String class static method is similar to method System.out.printf, but returns
a formatted String rather than displaying a String in a command window.
c) If a method contains a local variable with the same name as one of its class’s fields, the
local variable the field in that method’s scope.
d) The public methods of a class are also known as the class’s or .
e) A(n) declaration specifies one class to import.
f) If a class declares constructors, the compiler will not create a(n) .
g) An object’s method is called implicitly when an object appears in code where
a String is needed.
h) Get methods are commonly called or .
i) A(n) method tests whether a condition is true or false.
j) For every enum, the compiler generates a static method called that returns an
array of the enum’s constants in the order in which they were declared.
k) Composition is sometimes referred to as a(n) relationship.
l) A(n) declaration contains a comma-separated list of constants.
m) A(n) variable represents classwide information that’s shared by all the objects
of the class.
n) A(n) declaration imports one static member.
o) The states that code should be granted only the amount of privilege and access
that it needs to accomplish its designated task.
p) Keyword specifies that a variable is not modifiable after initialiation in a declaration
or constructor.
q) A(n) declaration imports only the classes that the program uses from a particular
package.
r) Set methods are commonly called because they typically change a value.
s) Use class to perform precise monetary calculations.
t) Use the statement to indicate that a problem has occurred.

aspects of package access.

8.3 What happens when a return type, even void, is specified for a constructor?

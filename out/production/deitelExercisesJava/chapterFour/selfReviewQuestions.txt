Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
a) All programs can be written in terms of three types of control structures: Sequence, Selection, & Repetition
b) The if, else statement is used to execute one action when a condition is true and another
when that condition is false.
c) Repeating a set of instructions a specific number of times is called counter controlled iteration.
d) When it’s not known in advance how many times a set of statements will be repeated,
a sentinel value can be used to terminate the iteration.
e) The sequence structure is built into Java; by default, statements execute in the order
they appear.
f) Instance variables of types char, byte, short, int, long, float and double are all given
the value 0 (Zero) by default.
g) If the increment operator is prefixed to a variable, first the variable is incremented by
1, then its new value is used in the expression.
h) When the declaration int y = 5; is followed by the assignment y += 3.3; the value of y
is 3.3.

4.2 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
a) An algorithm is a procedure for solving a problem in terms of the actions to execute and
the order in which they execute.
    True.
b) A set of statements contained within a pair of parentheses is called a block.
    False.
c) A selection statement repeats an action while a condition remains true.
        False. That is done by repetition statements
d) A nested control statement appears in the body of another control statement.
    True.
e) Java provides the arithmetic compound assignment operators +=, -=, *=, /= and %= for
abbreviating assignment expressions.
    True.
f) The primitive types (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double) are portable
across only Windows platforms.
    False. The primitive types are portable across all computer platforms that support Java.

g) Specifying the order in which statements execute in a program is called program control.
    True.
h) The unary cast operator (double) creates a temporary integer copy of its operand.
    False. The unary cast operator (double) creates a temporary floating point copy of its operand.
i) Instance variables of type boolean are given the value true by default.
    False. They are given False
j) Pseudocode helps you think out a program before attempting to write it in a programming
language.
    True.

4.3 Write four different Java statements that each add 1 to integer variable x.
    integer x = 1
    integer x = x+1;
    integer x++;
    integer ++x

4.4 Write Java statements to accomplish each of the following tasks:
a) Use one statement to assign the sum of x and y to z, then increment x by 1.
        x = y + z;

b) Test whether variable count is greater than 10. If it is, print "Count is greater than 10".
        if(count>10){
        System.out.print("Count is greater than 10");
        }
c) Use one statement to decrement the variable x by 1, then subtract it from variable total and store the result in variable total.
        total = total - --x;
d) Calculate the remainder after q is divided by divisor, and assign the result to q.
    Write this statement in two different ways.

            q %= divider;
            q = q % divider;

4.5 Write a Java statement to accomplish each of the following tasks:
a) Declare variable sum of type int and initialize it to 0.
        int sum = 0;
b) Declare variable x of type int and initialize it to 1.
        int sum = 1;
c) Add variable x to variable sum, and assign the result to variable sum.
        sum = sum + x;
d) Print "The sum is: ", followed by the value of variable sum.
    System.out.println("The sum is: ", + sum);
    System.out.printf("The sum is %d%n", sum);

4.7 Determine the value of the variables in the following statement after the calculation is performed.
    Assume that when the statement begins executing, all variables are type int and have the value 5.
    product *= x++;
    product = 25, x = 6

4.8 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following sets of code:
a) while ( c <= 5 )
     {
    product *= c;
    ++c;
    }

    b) if ( gender == 1 )
    System.out.println( "Woman" );
    else
    System.out.println( "Man" );

    The closing right brace of the while statement’s body is missing.
    Add a closing right brace after the statement ++c;.

4.9 What is wrong with the following while statement?
    while ( z >= 0 )
    sum += z;

    The value of the variable z is never changed in the while statement and if the loop-continuation condition ( z >= 0 ) is true, an infinite loop is created.
    To prevent an infinite loop , z must be incremented or decremented so that it eventually becomes less than or greater than 0.

4.10 Compare and contrast the if single-selection statement and the while repetition statement. How are these two statements similar? How are they different?
    An if statement checks if an expression is true or false, and then runs the code inside the statement only if it is true. The code inside the loop is only run once.
    A while statement is a loop. Basically, it continues to execute the code in the while statement for however long the expression is true.

4.11 Explain what happens when a Java program attempts to divide one integer by another.
     What happens to the fractional part of the calculation? How can a programmer avoid that outcome?

     Java does integer division, which basically is the same as regular real division, but you throw(trauncate) away the remainder (or fraction).
     Thus, 7 / 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1. Throw away the remainder, and the result is 2.

     Precision Division: In a case where, we may need the complete result of the division along with its fraction, In such scenarios, either both of the variables used for division must be double or float type or at least the denominator must be double or float data type.

4.12 Describe the two ways in which control statements can be combined.
      Control statement entry point and exit point stacking
      Control statement nesting

4.13 What type of repetition would be appropriate for obtaining an input from the user until the
     user indicates there is no more input to provide?
     Sentinel controlled loop to mark the end of data entry

     What type would be appropriate for calculating the factorial of 5?
     Briefly describe how each of these tasks could be performed.

     int x = 5
      while (x > 0){
                 sum *= x;
                 x--;
                 System.out.println(x);

             }

4.14 If integers x and y are set to 7 and 3, what is the value of x after x = y++ and x = ++y?
        x = 7;
        y = 3;

        x = y++;
       (3)
        x = ++y;
        (5)

4.15 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following pieces of code. [Note: There may be
more than one error in each piece of code.]
a)    if (age >= 65)
        {
            System.out.println("Age is greater than or equal to 65");
                }
                else {
                    System.out.println("Age is less than 65");
                        }

b)          int x = 1, total = 0;
            while (x <= 10) {
                total = ++x;
                System.out.println(x);
            }

c)  while (x <= 100) {
        total += x;
        ++x;
        }

d) while (y =! 0) {
    System.out.println(y);
    }
